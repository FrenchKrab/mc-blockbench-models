Here are various minecraft models made in [BlockBench](https://www.blockbench.net/). Their quality and style vary wildy but everything is free (that's pretty rare for minecraft models, strangely). You're free to use them however you like as long as you credit me.

Tools are setup to be used in resource packs. Mobs are setup to be used with Model Engine (and more precisely with EliteMobs).
